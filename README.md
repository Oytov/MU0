# MU0
MU0 CPU emulator/interpreter

I am learning C so I decided to create this interpreter for the MU0 cpu. From information I read somewhere on the internet - the MU0 CPU is a virtual cpu designed in the Manchester University. It has 1 register acc (accumulator, eax on x86) and 8 instructions. Ive also implemented a special instruction `PUT` it just prints out the value of the accumulator.

I am going to implement a few features like pointers, eventually.
